This repository contains the implementation of the research experiments carried out for the project along with the flask development server to obtain a   summarization for any legal case. Just feed the input in the text area and the four text areas should populate with summaries as a result of different models. Please note that generating the response might take a while depending on the hardware of your system.

Screenshot of a very short example is attached below with the summary outputs from their respective models.

Kindly setup up the server by downloading the dependencies in the requirements.txt file. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once all the dependencies are installed and configured, simply run the following command to start the server: 

```
python summarize.py
```
